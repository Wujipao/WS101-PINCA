# WS101 — Laboratory 5

This repository contains the materials and code for Laboratory 5 of the WS101 course.

## Project overview

This project is a To-Do List web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks.

It implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using a Spring Boot backend and a JavaScript frontend that communicates via the Fetch API.

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how a frontend interface interacts with a RESTful API server to perform database operations, applying key web development concepts learned in WS101.n

## FEATURES
Create: Add a new to-do item with a description, target date, and completion status

Read: Display all existing to-do items in a dynamic table

Update: Edit an existing to-do item’s details

Delete: Remove a task from the list

Visual Enhancements: Color-coded buttons (blue for edit, red for delete), gradient background, and live updates
